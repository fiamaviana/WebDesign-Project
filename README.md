JJF Tours was my first web page project developed during college.
It was developed by me, Fiama, together with two other colleagues: João Vitor and Josélia Reis. We created a fake company called JJF tours based on our initials.
The proposal was to build a commercial website with at least four pages, but we decided to create six pages. Where I was responsible for developing the homepage and reservations page.
We planned together and also did a survey to define our client persona, and we also researched other tourism companies in Ireland.
After that, we create Wireframes and define which Design Patterns we would apply to each page.
Each of us has fully developed his pages using HTML, CSS and javascript using validation and responsive page.
The web page was deployed using GitHub and we tested the web page's performance and debugged some errors.
Search engine optimization and other testing tools were also performed on this project.
