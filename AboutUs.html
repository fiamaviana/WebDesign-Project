				<h1>About US</h1>
				<p >Hello folks, welcome to JJF tours. We are glad to have you here.</p>
				<p >We are three friends that have a passion for travel as a common point and, in 2020, after exploring Dublin,
				we realized that it was possible to mix our interests and create amazing tours options to visit Dublin.</p>
				<p>Combining our passions, we created JJF tours to offer to our public tours to places that were previously visited by us.
				We have had the opportunity to know new places and we are continually  learning about the local history.
				Now we want to share with you and make your day unforgettable.</p>
				<p>Our tours are carefully prepared, with modern and good structure to travel, which include comfortable and luxurious bus,
				experienced guides and personalized tours with small groups.</p>
				<p> We believe that travel is a journey through diversity, culture and history.
				Our mission is to share with you our passion for traveling and  providing
				tours that will give a real and deep experience about the place that you chose to visit. </p>
				<p>Let us show you who we are:</p>
