							Margareth: Back home after two weeks in Dublin, I got a feeling that I
							should have spent more time there. What a wonderful place and the tours
							are fabulous. Thank you JFF for this incredible experience.
							<a href="#" class="fa fa-facebook"></a>
						</div>
						<div class="reviews">
							Philip: We travelled with two kids and we had such a great time, the bus is
							very comfortable. Michal, 5 years old, could easily sleep there when
							he felt tired. And the tour guide and Driver, Paul, is awesome, very kind 
							and funny.
							<a href="#" class="fa fa-facebook"></a>
						</div>
						<div class="reviews">
							Marina: For sure, the best trip I have had and thanks to this amazing tour. I
							visited all I wanted to in a good time, with no rush. I had enough time to 
							visit the museums and Trinity College was the best for me, thank you.

						<div class="reviews">
							Richard: I can't wait to visit Dublin again with you guys, you are the best tour company.
							The guide is very charismatic  and knowledgeable. Seriously, I personally  think 
							he knows everything about the history of Dublin. I am already planning on how to 
							return to this wonderful country.

						<div class="reviews">
							Alice: Unforgettable Ireland Trip! Having never been to Ireland, I reached out to
							JJF tours to help me navigate/plan my trip. Through many emails with Fiama,
							we planned the most wonderful journey in Dublin city.
							<a href="#" class="fa fa-facebook"></a>
						</div>
						<div class="reviews">
							Mary: While visiting Ireland last week we wanted to book a tour with a guide to 
							ensure we were really learning and seeing all that Dublin  has to offer. 
							Usually we do self guided type tours and I'm SO glad we chose to tour with JJF tours 
							rather than try to get around the area on our own! We had such a fun day seeing all that
							this area of the country has to offer.
